# Agent Guidelines

- Favor clear, task-oriented commit messages and PR summaries.
- When editing documentation, keep headings in sentence case and include updated feature lists when scope changes.
- Prefer tables or bullet lists to capture requirements and checklists succinctly.
- Do not change Flutter source formatting without running `dart format` on touched Dart files.
- Keep configuration and secrets out of the repository; use placeholders where necessary.
